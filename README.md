sortdirs
========

Re-order the directory entries in a filesystem.

This doesn't matter because nobody cares about the order entries are
stored on disk. All software sorts filenames (by name, date, type,
or whatever) on the fly.

Except your Pioneer car stereo and Sandisk music player. They play
music files in the order they appear in the directory, so you need to
re-order your directory entries after adding anything to your SD card.
